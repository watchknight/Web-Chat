git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
```

**Example:**
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/modernchat.git

## Step 3: Add Only Project Files

```bash
# Add all your project files (gitignore will exclude .vscode and AppData)
git add .gitignore index.html script.js styles.css firebase-config.js *.md
